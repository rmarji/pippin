# Progress

• Recent Achievements:  
  1. Replaced simulated news fetching with LinkupClient in FetchNewsActivity for more realistic results.  
  2. Disabled certain Twitter-related activities (PostTweetActivity, PostRecentMemoriesTweetActivity) per request to focus on other priorities.  
  3. Updated activity constraints, including a new MockTweetActivity placeholder.  
  4. Created Cline Documentation (productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md) to ensure maintainability and continuity.

• Remaining Tasks:  
  1. MockTweetActivity Implementation: Develop a minimal logging-only tweet function.  
  2. Cleanup of leftover references to non-existent files that generate Pylance warnings.  
  3. Ongoing refinement of the news activity (improved filtering, caching strategies, etc.).  
  4. Evaluate the money-making idea generation & evaluation flow for deeper functionality.

Overall Status:  
The project is moving toward a more flexible, configurable system, with a robust foundation for further expansions. The new documentation ensures easy understanding and helps maintain continuity through future updates.
