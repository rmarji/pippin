# Product Context

This project implements a “Digital Being” that runs various automated activities, such as fetching news, generating daily thoughts, performing money evaluations, and more. It provides a framework for modular activities that can interact with external services and simulate internal “thought” processes:
• Purpose: Offer a dynamic, AI-driven “personal companion” or “digital assistant” that can integrate diverse features like retrieving external data, performing analyses, and maintaining a memory of past activities.  
• Problem Solved: Allows users to automate and centralize multiple tasks in one place—such as summarizing news, performing daily reflections, scheduling naps, and exploring money-making ideas—so it streamlines workflows and saves time.
• Operational Flow: Each activity runs independently on a schedule or invocation, logs successes/failures and data, and can optionally merge results into a shared memory for subsequent use.
