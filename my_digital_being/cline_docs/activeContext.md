# Active Context

This file explains the current focus of development and recent updates:

• We've introduced new activity constraints that disable certain activities (like PostTweetActivity) and allow new ones (e.g., MockTweetActivity).  
• We integrated LinkupClient to fetch news within FetchNewsActivity, replacing the previously simulated approach.  
• Twitter integration is currently on hold, and references to Twitter-based activities have been toggled off.  
• Some suspicious Pylance errors refer to non-existent files (e.g., activity_evaluate ideas for making money.py), indicating leftover references or stale indexing, which appear safe to ignore since those files do not actually exist.  

Next Steps:
• Continue refining the news fetching process (e.g., better filtering or fallback sources).  
• Add a MockTweetActivity for demonstration or testing.  
• Move forward with any new feature requests while preserving the existing codebase.  
• Investigate and remove or update any references to non-existent files in the project’s configuration to clear pending linter/tool warnings.
