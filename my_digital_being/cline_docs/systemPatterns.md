# System Patterns

1. Modular Activities:
   - Each activity is encapsulated in its own file and class.
   - Activities adhere to a lifecycle of initialization and execution, returning structured ActivityResult objects.

2. Scheduling and Configuration:
   - The system uses activity_constraints.json to enable or disable activities as needed.
   - Client code or schedulers call these activities based on configuration, ensuring flexible adjustments without code deletions.

3. Shared Memory:
   - Activities can share data by writing results into memory or retrieving from memory to maintain continuity between runs.

4. External Integrations:
   - The system interacts with external APIs (e.g., LinkupClient for news).
   - Integrations can be toggled on/off, making the system extensible and easily reconfigurable.

5. Logging and Error Handling:
   - Each activity logs success/failure and any generated data.
   - Failures can be traced through logs, and the system can selectively retry or disable problematic features.

Overall, this pattern ensures a loosely coupled approach, allowing for independent iteration on each activity while retaining a cohesive framework.
